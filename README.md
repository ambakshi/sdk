# Network Next SDK

## Welcome to Network Next!

Network Next is a marketplace for premium network transit.

Typically, Network Next is used for latency sensitive applications like first person shooters and twitch games. 

For example, Network Next is production with [Rocket League](https://rocketleague.com) and is accelerating millions of players per-day.

## Building Network Next

To use Network Next, you must integrate SDK integrates with your game client and server.

Our SDK is extremely simple, and basically replaces the sendto/recvfrom for UDP packets, in order to steer game traffic across private networks with better performance than the public internet.

To get started, first build the SDK from the source code in this repository.

Visit [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/networknext/sdk/blob/master/BUILDING.md) for a guide for building on Windows, Mac and Linux.

If you'd like to use our SDK for game consoles (PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), please email sales@networknext.com. We need to see proof that you are a licenced developer for these platforms before we can share this code with you.
