# Network Next SDK

## What is Network Next?

Network Next is a marketplace for premium network transit. 

We work with top infrastructure suppliers such as:

* Limelight
* Stackpath
* Packet
* Zenlayer
* Multiplay
* I3D
* Vultr.com

And cloud providers such as:

* AWS
* Google
* Azure
* IBM Bluemix
* Oracle Gloud

To accelerate network transit from player connections to dedicated game servers.

We do this by steering game traffic across the most optimal path between client and server, rather than leaving those details up to BGP and standard internet routing.

This way we're able to dynamically pick the lowest path for each player, every 10 seconds, and switch instantly if a problem occurs with the current route.

## What is the Network Next SDK?

Network Next SDK is how we steer traffic across the best path from each player to the game server.
