# Network Next SDK

## Welcome to Network Next!

Network Next is a marketplace for premium network transit.

Typically, Network Next is used for latency sensitive applications like multiplayer games.

For example, Network Next is production with [Rocket League](https://rocketleague.com) and is accelerating millions of sessions per-day.

## Building Network Next

To use Network Next, you must integrate the Network Next SDK with your game client and server.

Our SDK is extremely simple, and basically replaces the sendto/recvfrom API you already use to send UDP packets, in order to steer traffic across private networks with better performance than the public internet.

To get started, first visit [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/networknext/sdk/blob/master/BUILDING.md) for a guide for building on Windows, Mac and Linux.

If you'd like to build our SDK on game consoles (PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), please email sales@networknext.com. Unfortunately, due to licencing restrictions, we need proof that you are a licenced developer for these platforms before we can share this code with you.

## Usage and Next Steps

Once you have built the SDK, please read [USAGE.md](https://github.com/networknext/sdk/blob/master/USAGE.md) to learn how to use Network Next.

We also have a [FAQ](https://github.com/networknext/sdk/blob/master/FAQ.md) which answers common questions people have about Network Next.

Finally, if you'd like to evaluate usage of Network Next for your commercial project (whether it is a game or not), please reach out to sales@networknext.com and we can set you up with a free trial.

cheers
