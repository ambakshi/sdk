# Network Next

## Welcome to Network Next!

[Network Next](https://networknext.com) is a marketplace for premium network transit.

It's used by multiplayer games to get better network performance for their players when they play online.

Network Next is in production with [Rocket League](https://rocketleague.com) and is accelerating millions of sessions per-day!

## Building Network Next

To use Network Next, you must integrate the Network Next SDK with your game client and server.

Our SDK is extremely simple, and is designed to replace the sendto/recvfrom API you already use to send UDP packets.

To get started, first visit [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/networknext/sdk/blob/master/BUILDING.md) for a guide for building on Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Usage and Next Steps

Once you have built the SDK, please read [USAGE.md](https://github.com/networknext/sdk/blob/master/USAGE.md) to get started using Network Next.

We also have a [FAQ](https://github.com/networknext/sdk/blob/master/FAQ.md) which answers common questions people have about Network Next.

Finally, if you'd like to evaluate Network Next for your commercial project (whether it's a game or not), please reach out to sales@networknext.com and we'll set you up with a free trial.

cheers
