# Network Next SDK

## Welcome to Network Next!

Network Next is a marketplace for premium network transit.

Typically, Network Next is used for latency sensitive applications like first person shooters and twitch games. Although we are interested in exploring other use cases. Please contact sales@networknext.com if you have a non-gaming use case you'd like to explore with us.

## Building Network Next

First, build the SDK from the source code in this repository.

Please visit [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/networknext/sdk/blob/master/BUILDING.md) for a guide for building on Windows, Mac and Linux.

If you'd like to build this SDK for game consoles (PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch) we have support for these platforms, but unfortunately cannot open this source code due to licencing restrictions. 

Access to this code requires that you prove to us that you are a licenced developer for each of these platforms. Please contact sales@networknext.com to get access to console source code.
