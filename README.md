# Network Next SDK

## What is Network Next?

Network Next is a marketplace for premium network transit. 

We sell 10 seconds of slices of access to private networks, with lower latency, congestion and packet loss than the public internet.

This results in improved transit from players around the world to your game servers, with players experiencing reduced latency, jitter and packet loss.

To accelerate network transit from player connections to dedicated game servers.

We do this by steering game traffic across the most optimal path between client and server, rather than leaving those details up to BGP and standard internet routing.

This way we're able to dynamically pick the lowest path for each player, every 10 seconds, and switch instantly if a problem occurs with the current route.
